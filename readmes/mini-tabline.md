## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-tabline.mp4 -->
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24854248/173045373-f5bdea82-fe3e-4488-8c9a-ebba062a373c.mp4

## Features

- Buffers are listed in the order of their identifier.
- Different highlight groups for "states" of buffer affecting 'buffer tabs'.
- Buffer names are made unique by extending paths to files or appending unique identifier to buffers without name.
- Current buffer is displayed "optimally centered" (in center of screen while maximizing the total number of buffers shown) when there are many buffers open.
- 'Buffer tabs' are clickable if Neovim allows it.
- Extra information section in case of multiple Neovim tabpages.
- Truncation symbols which show if there are tabs to the left and/or right. Exact characters are taken from 'listchars' option (`precedes` and `extends` fields) and are shown only if 'list' option is enabled.

## Dependencies

For full experience needs (still works without any of suggestions):

- Enabled ['mini.icons'](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-icons) module to show icons near file names. Can fall back to using [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) plugin.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.tabline').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Whether to show file icons (requires 'mini.icons')
  show_icons = true,

  -- Function which formats the tab label
  -- By default surrounds with space and possibly prepends with icon
  format = nil,

  -- Where to show tabpage section in case of multiple vim tabpages.
  -- One of 'left', 'right', 'none'.
  tabpage_section = 'left',
}
```
