## Demo

## Features

Which buffer to show in window(s) after its current buffer is removed is decided by the algorithm:

- If alternate buffer is listed, use it.
- If previous listed buffer is different, use it.
- Otherwise create a scratch one with `nvim_create_buf(true, true)` and use it.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: no need to call `require('mini.bufremove').setup()`, but it can be done to improve usability.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Whether to disable showing non-error feedback
  silent = false,
}
```
