## Demo

## Features

- Single window general purpose interface for picking element from any array.

- On demand toggleable preview and info views.

- Interactive query matching (filter+sort) with fast non-blocking default which does fuzzy matching and allows other modes.

- Built-in pickers:
    - Files.
    - Pattern match (for fixed pattern or with live feedback; both allow file filtering via glob patterns).
    - Buffers.
    - Help tags.
    - CLI output.
    - Resume latest picker.

- `:Pick` command to work with extensible `MiniPick.registry`.

- `vim.ui.select()` implementation. To adjust, use `MiniPick.ui_select()` or save-restore `vim.ui.select` manually after calling `MiniPick.setup()`.

- Rich and customizable built-in actions when picker is active:
    - Manually change currently focused item.
    - Scroll vertically and horizontally.
    - Toggle preview or info view.
    - Mark/unmark items to choose later.
    - Refine current matches (make them part of a new picker).
    - And many more.

- Minimal yet flexible source specification with:
    - Items (array, callable, or manually set later).
    - Source name.
    - Working directory.
    - Matching algorithm.
    - Way matches are shown in main window.
    - Item preview.
    - "On choice" action for current and marked items.

- Custom actions/keys can be configured globally, per buffer, or per picker.

- Out of the box support for 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'.

- Match caching to increase responsiveness on repeated prompts.

Notes:

- Works on all supported versions but Neovim>=0.10 will give more visual feedback in floating window footer.

- For more pickers see ['mini.extra'](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-extra).

- CLI tools are called only with basic arguments needed to get items. To customize the output, use their respective configuration approaches. Here are some examples of where to start:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file)
  - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#excluding-specific-files-or-directories)
  - [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

- `:h MiniPick-overview`
- `:h MiniPick-source`
- `:h MiniPick-actions`
- `:h MiniPick-examples`
- `:h MiniPick.builtin`

## Dependencies

For full experience needs (still works without any of suggestions):

- Enabled ['mini.icons'](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-icons) module for icons near the items representing actual paths. Can fall back to using [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) plugin.

- Executable [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) CLI tool for faster file and pattern search on disk.

## Overview

General idea is to take array of objects, display them with interactive filter/sort/navigate/preview, and allow to choose one or more items.

### How to start a picker

- Use `MiniPick.start()` with `opts.source` defining source.

    Example: `MiniPick.start({ source = { items = vim.fn.readdir('.') } })`

- Use any of `MiniPick.builtin` pickers directly.

    Example: `MiniPick.builtin.files({ tool = 'git' })`

- Use `:Pick` command which uses customizable pickers from `MiniPick.registry`.

    Example: `:Pick files tool='git'`

### User interface

UI consists from a single window capable of displaying three different views:

- "Main" - where current query matches are shown.
- "Preview" - preview of current item (toggle with `<Tab>`).
- "Info" - general info about picker and its state (toggle with `<S-Tab>`).

Current prompt is displayed at the top left of the window border with vertical line indicating caret (current input position).

Bottom part of window border displays (in Neovim>=0.10) extra visual feedback:

- Left part is a picker name.
- Right part contains information in the format:

    `<current index in matches> | <match count> | <marked count> / <total count>`

When picker is busy (like if there are no items yet set or matching is active) window border changes color to be `MiniPickBorderBusy` after `config.delay.busy` milliseconds of idle time.

### Life cycle

- Type characters to filter and sort matches. It uses `MiniPick.default_match()` with `query` being an array of pressed characters. Overview of how it matches:
    - If query starts with `'`, the match is exact.
    - If query starts with `^`, the match is exact at start.
    - If query ends with `$`, the match is exact at end.
    - If query starts with `*`, the match is forced to be fuzzy.
    - Otherwise match is fuzzy.
    - Sorting is done to first minimize match width and then match start.
      Nothing more: no favoring certain places in string, etc.

- Type special keys to perform actions. Here are some basic ones:
    - `<C-n>` / `<Down>` moves down; `<C-p>` / `<Up>` moves up.
    - `<Left>` / `<Right>` moves prompt caret left / right.
    - `<S-Tab>` toggles information window with all available mappings.
    - `<Tab>` toggles preview.
    - `<C-x>` / `<C-a>` toggles current / all item(s) as (un)marked.
    - `<C-Space>` / `<M-Space>` makes all matches or marked items as new picker.
    - `<CR>` / `<M-CR>` chooses current/marked item(s).
    - `<Esc>` / `<C-c>` stops picker.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.pick').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.
