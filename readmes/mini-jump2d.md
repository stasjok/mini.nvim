## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-jump2d.mp4 -->

## Features

- Make jump by iterative filtering of possible, equally considered jump spots until there is only one. Filtering is done by typing a label character that is visualized at jump spot.
- Customizable:
    - Way of computing possible jump spots with opinionated default.
    - Characters used to label jump spots during iterative filtering.
    - Visual effects: how many steps ahead to show; dim lines with spots.
    - Action hooks to be executed at certain events during jump.
    - Allowed windows: current and/or not current.
    - Allowed lines: whether to process blank or folded lines, lines before/at/after cursor line, etc. Example: user can configure to look for spots only inside current window at or after cursor line.
    Example: user can configure to look for word starts only inside current window at or after cursor line with 'j' and 'k' labels performing some action after jump.
- Works in Visual and Operator-pending (with dot-repeat) modes.
- Preconfigured ways of computing jump spots (see help for `MiniJump2d.builtin_opts()`):
    - Starts of lines.
    - Starts of words.
    - Single character from user input.
    - Variable length query from user input.
- Works with multibyte characters.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.jump2d').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Function producing jump spots (byte indexed) for a particular line.
  -- For more information see |MiniJump2d.start|.
  -- If `nil` (default) - use |MiniJump2d.default_spotter|
  spotter = nil,

  -- Characters used for labels of jump spots (in supplied order)
  labels = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',

  -- Options for visual effects
  view = {
    -- Whether to dim lines with at least one jump spot
    dim = false,

    -- How many steps ahead to show. Set to big number to show all steps.
    n_steps_ahead = 0,
  },

  -- Which lines are used for computing spots
  allowed_lines = {
    blank = true, -- Blank line (not sent to spotter even if `true`)
    cursor_before = true, -- Lines before cursor line
    cursor_at = true, -- Cursor line
    cursor_after = true, -- Lines after cursor line
    fold = true, -- Start of fold (not sent to spotter even if `true`)
  },

  -- Which windows from current tabpage are used for visible lines
  allowed_windows = {
    current = true,
    not_current = true,
  },

  -- Functions to be executed at certain events
  hooks = {
    before_start = nil, -- Before jump start
    after_jump = nil, -- After jump was actually done
  },

  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    start_jumping = '<CR>',
  },

  -- Whether to disable showing non-error feedback
  -- This also affects (purely informational) helper messages shown after
  -- idle time if user input is required.
  silent = false,
}
```
