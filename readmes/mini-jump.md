Initial idea and implementation by [Adam Blažek](https://github.com/xigoi).

## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-jump.mp4 -->
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24854248/173044762-f0f50a73-02df-4432-a79e-54b0ddaa1e48.mp4

## Features

- Extend f, F, t, T to work on multiple lines.
- Repeat jump by pressing f, F, t, T again. It is reset when cursor moved as a result of not jumping or timeout after idle time (duration customizable).
- Highlight (after customizable delay) all possible target characters and stop it after some (customizable) idle time.
- Normal, Visual, and Operator-pending (with full dot-repeat) modes are supported.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.jump').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    forward = 'f',
    backward = 'F',
    forward_till = 't',
    backward_till = 'T',
    repeat_jump = ';',
  },

  -- Delay values (in ms) for different functionalities. Set any of them to
  -- a very big number (like 10^7) to virtually disable.
  delay = {
    -- Delay between jump and highlighting all possible jumps
    highlight = 250,

    -- Delay between jump and automatic stop if idle (no jump is done)
    idle_stop = 10000000,
  },

  -- Whether to disable showing non-error feedback
  -- This also affects (purely informational) helper messages shown after
  -- idle time if user input is required.
  silent = false,
}
```
