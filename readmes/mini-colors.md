## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-colors.mp4 -->
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24854248/232283566-9a51fa55-d20a-4650-8205-763b55e21366.mp4

## Features

- Create colorscheme object (see `:h MiniColors-colorscheme`): either manually (`:h MiniColors.as_colorscheme()`) or by querying present color schemes (including currently active one; see `:h MiniColors.get_colorscheme()`).

- Infer data about color scheme and/or modify based on it:
    - Add transparency by removing background color (requires transparency in terminal emulator).
    - Infer cterm attributes based on gui colors making it compatible with 'notermguicolors'.
    - Resolve highlight group links.
    - Compress by removing redundant highlight groups.
    - Extract palette of used colors and/or infer terminal colors based on it.

- Modify colors to better fit your taste and/or goals:
    - Apply any function to color hex string.
    - Update channels (like lightness, saturation, hue, temperature, red, green, blue, etc.).
      Use either own function or one of the implemented methods:
        - Add value to channel or multiply it by coefficient. Like "add 10 to saturation of every color" or "multiply saturation by 2" to make colors more saturated (less gray).
        - Invert. Like "invert lightness" to convert between dark/light theme.
        - Set to one or more values (picks closest to current one). Like "set to one or two hues" to make mono- or dichromatic color scheme.
        - Repel from certain source(s) with stronger effect for closer values. Like "repel from hue 30" to remove red color from color scheme. Repel hue (how much is removed) is configurable.
    - Simulate color vision deficiency.

- Once color scheme is ready, either apply it to see effects right away or write it into a Lua file as a fully functioning separate color scheme.

- Experiment interactively with a feedback.

- Animate transition between color schemes either with `MiniColors.animate()` or with `:Colorscheme` user command.

- Convert within supported color spaces (`MiniColors.convert()`):
    - Hex string.
    - 8-bit number (terminal colors).
    - RGB.
    - Oklab, Oklch, Okhsl (https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/).

## Tweak quick start

- Execute `:lua require('mini.colors').interactive()`.
- Experiment by writing calls to exposed color scheme methods and applying them with `<M-a>`. For more information, see `:h MiniColors-colorscheme-methods` and `:h MiniColors-recipes`.
- If you are happy with result, write color scheme with `<M-w>`. If not, reset to initial color scheme with `<M-r>`.
- If only some highlight groups can be made better, adjust them manually inside written color scheme file.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: no need to call `require('mini.colors').setup()`, but it can be done to improve usability.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{}
```
