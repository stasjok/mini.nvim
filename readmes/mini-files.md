## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-files.mp4 -->

## Features

- Navigate file system using column view (Miller columns) to display nested directories. See `:h MiniFiles-navigation` for overview.

- Opt-in preview of file or directory under cursor.

- Manipulate files and directories by editing text buffers: create, delete, copy, rename, move. See `:h MiniFiles-manipulation` for overview.

- Use as default file explorer instead of `netrw`.

- Configurable:
    - Filter/prefix/sort of file system entries.
    - Mappings used for common explorer actions.
    - UI options: whether to show preview of file/directory under cursor, etc.
    - Bookmarks for quicker navigation.

See `:h MiniFiles-examples` for some common configuration examples.

Notes:

- This module is written and thoroughly tested on Linux. Support for other platform/OS (like Windows or MacOS) is a goal, but there is no guarantee.

- This module silently reacts to not enough permissions:
    - In case of missing file, check its or its parent read permissions.
    - In case of no manipulation result, check write permissions.

## Dependencies

For full experience needs (still works without any of suggestions):

- Enabled ['mini.icons'](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-icons) module to show icons near file/directory names. Can fall back to using [nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons) plugin.

## Quick start

### Navigation

- Run `:lua MiniFiles.open()`.

- Navigate:
    - Press `j`/`k` to navigate down/up.
    - Press `l` to expand entry under cursor: show directory or open file in the most recent window.
    - Press `h` to go to parent directory.
    - Type `m<char>` to set directory path of focused window as bookmark `<char>`. Jump to it with `'<char>`. Go back to before the latest jump with `''`.
    - Type `g?` for more information about other available mappings and bookmarks.
    - Move as in any other buffer (`$`, `G`, `f`/`t`, etc.).

For deeper overview, see `:h MiniFiles-navigation`.

### Manipulation

- Navigate to the directory in which manipulation should be done.

- Edit buffer in the way representing file system action:
    - **Create file/directory**: create new line like `file` or `dir/`.
    - **Create file/directory in the descendant directory**: create new line like `dir/file` or `dir/nested/`.
    - **Delete file/directory**: delete whole line representing that entry.
    - **Rename file/directory**: change text to the right of that entry's icon.
    - **Copy file/directory**: copy whole line and paste it in target directory.
    - **Move file/directory**: cut whole line and paste it in target directory.

- Press `=`; **read confirmation dialog**; confirm with `y`/`<CR>` or not confirm with `n`/`<Esc>`.

For deeper overview, see `:h MiniFiles-manipulation`.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.files').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Customization of shown content
  content = {
    -- Predicate for which file system entries to show
    filter = nil,
    -- Highlight group to use for a file system entry
    highlight = nil,
    -- Prefix text and highlight to show to the left of file system entry
    prefix = nil,
    -- Order in which to show file system entries
    sort = nil,
  },

  -- Module mappings created only inside explorer.
  -- Use `''` (empty string) to not create one.
  mappings = {
    close       = 'q',
    go_in       = 'l',
    go_in_plus  = 'L',
    go_out      = 'h',
    go_out_plus = 'H',
    mark_goto   = "'",
    mark_set    = 'm',
    reset       = '<BS>',
    reveal_cwd  = '@',
    show_help   = 'g?',
    synchronize = '=',
    trim_left   = '<',
    trim_right  = '>',
  },

  -- General options
  options = {
    -- Whether to delete permanently or move into module-specific trash
    permanent_delete = true,
    -- Whether to use for editing directories
    use_as_default_explorer = true,
  },

  -- Customization of explorer windows
  windows = {
    -- Maximum number of windows to show side by side
    max_number = math.huge,
    -- Whether to show preview of file/directory under cursor
    preview = false,
    -- Width of focused window
    width_focus = 50,
    -- Width of non-focused window
    width_nofocus = 15,
    -- Width of preview window
    width_preview = 25,
  },
}
```
