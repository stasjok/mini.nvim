## Demo

## Features

- `bench_time()` executes function several times and timing how long it took.
- `log_add()` / `log_show()` and other helper functions to work with a special in-memory log array. Useful when debugging Lua code (instead of `print()`).
- `put()` and `put_text()` print Lua objects in command line and current buffer respectively.
- `resize_window()` resizes current window to its editable width.
- `setup_auto_root()` sets up automated change of current directory.
- `setup_termbg_sync()` to set up terminal background synchronization (removes possible "frame" around current Neovim instance).
- `setup_restore_cursor()` sets up automated restoration of cursor position on file reopen.
- `stat_summary()` computes summary statistics of numerical array.
- `tbl_head()` and `tbl_tail()` return first and last elements of table.
- `zoom()` makes current buffer full screen in a floating window.
- And more.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: no need to call `require('mini.misc').setup()`, but it can be done to improve usability.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Array of fields to make global (to be used as independent variables)
  make_global = { 'put', 'put_text' },
}
```
