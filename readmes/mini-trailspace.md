## Features

- Highlighting is done only in modifiable buffer by default, only in Normal mode, and stops in Insert mode and when leaving window.
- Trim all trailing whitespace with `MiniTrailspace.trim()`.
- Trim all trailing empty lines with `MiniTrailspace.trim_last_lines()`.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.trailspace').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Highlight only in normal buffers (ones with empty 'buftype'). This is
  -- useful to not show trailing whitespace where it usually doesn't matter.
  only_in_normal_buffers = true,
}
```
