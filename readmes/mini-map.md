## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-map.mp4 -->
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24854248/195806215-10e05020-50b7-4bee-9447-ee5af3e971ec.mp4

## Features

- Show and manage special floating window displaying automatically updated overview of current buffer text. Window takes up whole height of Neovim instance and is fixed to a left/right side. Map content is computed by taking all current lines, converting it to binary whitespace/non-whitespace mask, rescaling to appropriate dimensions, and converting back to strings consisting from special encoding symbols. All this is done **very fast** and **asynchronously**.

    See `:h MiniMap.open()`, `:h MiniMap.refresh()`, `:h MiniMap.close()`, `:h MiniMap.toggle()`, `:h MiniMap.toggle_side()`.

    For a general overview and tips, see `:h mini.map-usage`.

- Show scrollbar next to map content. It represents current line and view (top and bottom visible lines). Can be the only thing shown, making map window a "pure scrollbar".

- Highlight map lines representing certain data in current buffer. This is done via extensible set of callables, called integrations. There are pre-built generators for common integrations:
    - Builtin search.
    - Builtin diagnostic.
    - General diff hunks provided by ['mini.diff'](https://nvim-mini.org/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-diff).
    - Hunks provided by ['lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim'](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim).
    For more details see `:h MiniMap.gen_integration`.

- Focus on map window to quickly browse current (source) buffer. Moving inside map window updates cursor position in source window enabling fast and targeted buffer exploration. To focus back, hit `<CR>` to accept current explored position or `<Esc>` to go back to original position. See `:h MiniMap.toggle_focus()`.

- Customizable:
    - Encoding symbols used to display binary information of different resolution (default is 3x2). There are pre-built generators for different basic character families and resolutions. See `:h MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols`.
    - Scrollbar symbols, separate for line and view. Can have any width (even zero, which virtually disables scrollbar).
    - Integrations producing map line highlights.
    - Window options: side (left/right), width, 'winblend', and more.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.map').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Highlight integrations (none by default)
  integrations = nil,

  -- Symbols used to display data
  symbols = {
    -- Encode symbols. See `:h MiniMap.config` for specification and
    -- `:h MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols` for pre-built ones.
    -- Default: solid blocks with 3x2 resolution.
    encode = nil,

    -- Scrollbar parts for view and line. Use empty string to disable any.
    scroll_line = '█',
    scroll_view = '┃',
  },

  -- Window options
  window = {
    -- Whether window is focusable in normal way (with `wincmd` or mouse)
    focusable = false,

    -- Side to stick ('left' or 'right')
    side = 'right',

    -- Whether to show count of multiple integration highlights
    show_integration_count = true,

    -- Total width
    width = 10,

    -- Value of 'winblend' option
    winblend = 25,

    -- Z-index
    zindex = 10,
  },
}
```
